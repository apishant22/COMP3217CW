Cybersecurity for Cyber-Physical Power Systems

The main model, XGBoost, is optimised for high accuracy and the ability to handle multi-class classification effectively.

Setup and Running
1. Go to Google Colab, "https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lSmRlXJdarYY_KwJN5ZPbCGQ__4aiTnf?usp=sharing"
2. Run each code cell one by one. This will run the best model.
3. The first cell ensures all required packages are installed. If any are missing, the script will automatically install them, providing a sense of security.
4. The second cell will retrieve the dataset from GitHub. This ensures ease of use.  
5. If you want to run the other models, you can easily do so by removing the code blocks surrounding the code and running its cell. 
6. Then, at the end, pick the model you want to run on the test file. The default is set to the best model. The code to run the other models is also commented out. So if you want to run it, please uncomment the model you want to run.
